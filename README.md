# New development choices for GD32VF103

**All the following resources are in English**

Nuclei have released [NMSIS](https://github.com/Nuclei-Software/NMSIS) and [Nuclei SDK](https://github.com/Nuclei-Software/nuclei-sdk)
to provide better support for Nuclei RISC-V Processor including GD32VF103.

We have modified the gd32vf103 firmware library to match NMSIS design,
which you can play with it using the following platforms:

* [Nuclei SDK](https://github.com/Nuclei-Software/nuclei-sdk)

* [PlatformIO For Nuclei](https://github.com/Nuclei-Software/platform-nuclei)

* [Nuclei Studio IDE](https://www.nucleisys.com/download.php)

* [Segger Embedded Studio](https://www.nucleisys.com/upload/files/doc/ses/Nuclei_SES_IDE_QuickStart_202008.pdf)

With the help of **Nuclei SDK**, **NMSIS**, **Nuclei Studio IDE**, it will be easier to
handle with RISC-V MCU development.

We also released a development board call [**Nuclei RV-STAR**](https://www.nucleisys.com/developboard.php),
which you can play with it by following https://doc.nucleisys.com/nuclei_board_labs/.
