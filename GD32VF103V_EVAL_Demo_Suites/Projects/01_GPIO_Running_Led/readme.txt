  This demo is based on the GD32VF103V-EVAL-V1.0 board, it provides a description of GPIO_Running_led. 
After the system is start-up, four LEDs will turn on one by one from LED1 to LED4 every 200ms,
and then turn off together. 200ms later, the four LEDs work like previous again.
  
  On the GD32VF103V-EVAL-V1.0 board,LED1 connected to PC0, LED2 connected to PC2, LED3 connected to 
PE0, LED4 connected to PE1.
